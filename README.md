# Rotational Cipher

The Rotational or Ceasar cipher is a simple shift cipher that relies on transposing all the
letters in the alphabet using an integer key between 0 and 26. Using a key of 0
or 26 will always yield the same output due to modular arithmetic. The letter is
shifted for as many values as the value of the key.
